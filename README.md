Traffic Simulation with NetLogo This repository contains a traffic simulation model using the NetLogo platform. The template was adapted from the "Traffic 2 Lanes" example included in the NetLogo template library.

### Traffic Simulation with NetLogo (Traffic-n-Lanes-with-latecomers)

#### Overview
This repository hosts a traffic simulation model built using NetLogo, based on the "Traffic 2 Lanes" example from the NetLogo models library.

#### Features
- **Slider for number of lanes:** Allows simulation with varying lane configurations.
- **Safety alerts:** Simulates adverse track conditions impacting driver behavior.
- **Adjustable driver patience:** Influences lane-changing behavior.
- **Average speed and traffic flow:** Monitors vehicle dynamics in the simulation.

#### Instructions for Use
1. **Install NetLogo:** Download and install NetLogo from [here](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/).
2. **Open the model:** Launch `Traffic-n-Lanes-with-latecomers.nlogo` in NetLogo.
3. **Adjust parameters:** Use sliders to modify simulation settings (e.g., cars, lanes, driver patience).
4. **Run the simulation:** Click "Setup" and then "Go" to start the simulation.
5. **Review results:** Analyze graphs and data monitors for insights.

#### Implemented Improvements
- **Fixed seed:** Ensures reproducibility of results.
- **Variable lane count:** Supports scenarios with 2 - 8 lanes.
- **Track alerts:** Simulates realistic adverse conditions.
- **Max speed storage:** Enables cars to regain speed post-alert.

#### Analyses Performed
The report explores how simulation parameters affect average speed and traffic flow:
- **Driver patience:** Optimal levels vary with traffic density.
- **Acceleration and deceleration:** Impact on speed and flow.
- **Lane count:** More lanes enhance flow and stabilize speed.
- **Safety alerts:** Temporarily reduce speed, enhancing safety.

#### Next Steps
Future enhancements could incorporate accidents, diverse vehicles, weather dynamics, and empirical validation using real-world data.
